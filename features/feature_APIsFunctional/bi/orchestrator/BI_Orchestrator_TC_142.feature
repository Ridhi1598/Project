Feature: Validate orchestrator response for create GPON-QINQ service request
  This features validates orchestrator response for failed create service request which passes Vlan Validation

  Scenario: Create GPON-QinQ Service which passes Vlan Validation but fails due to error from mediation
    Given I set data values against testcase
    And I set BI "RMQ" url
    And I set api endpoint for "publish" message for "sending"
    And I set request body for "publish" message for "sending"
    And Send request to "publish" message in RMQ queue
    And Validate that response body has "routed" as "true"
    And I set api endpoint for "read" message for "sending"
    And I set request body for "read" message for "sending"
    And Send request to "read" message in RMQ queue
    And Validate that there is no message in the RMQ queue
    When I "start" zookeeper connectivity for node validation
    Then Validate a request id is returned by resource entity as synchronous response
    And I validate that a "node" is "created" in zookeeper instance
    And Wait for the callback response from "resource entity"
    And I validate that a "node" is "deleted" in zookeeper instance
    When I "stop" zookeeper connectivity for node validation
    When I set BI "ES" url
    And I set api endpoint for "request" record for "read" ES message
    And I set request body for "request" record for "read" ES message
    And I validate that a "request" record is "created" in "bi-orchestrator-requests" index
    And I validate the "request_type" value in "external-request-tracker"
    And Validate a request id is returned by mediation layer as synchronous response
    And Wait for the callback response from "mediation layer"
    And I validate that a "request" record is "created" in "bi-orchestrator-requests" index
    And I validate record format for "request" response
    And Validate a callback response is returned by mediation layer as asynchronous response
    And Validate the "request_id" value in the response
    And Validate the "completed" value in the response
    And Validate the "state" value in the response
    And Validate there is a "category" field "not found" in the error message
    And I validate that request "state" is "failed"
    And I set api endpoint for "service" record for "read" ES message
    And I set request body for "service" record for "read" ES message
    And I validate that a "service" record is "not created" in "bi-orchestrator-services" index
    And I set BI "RMQ" url
    And I set api endpoint for "read" message for "callback"
    And I set request body for "read" message for "callback"
    And Send request to "read" message in RMQ queue
    And Validate that a "error" message is published to controller
    And Validate response format for "failed" message
    And Validate that the error "code" in callback is correctly mapped
