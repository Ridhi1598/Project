  This feature validates orchestrator response for create service request which times out

  Scenario: Create service request which times out
    Given I set data values against testcase
    And I set BI "RMQ" url
    And I set api endpoint for "publish" message for "sending"
    And I set request body for "publish" message for "sending"
    And Send request to "publish" message in RMQ queue
    And Validate that response body has "routed" as "true"
    And I set api endpoint for "read" message for "sending"
    And I set request body for "read" message for "sending"
    And Send request to "read" message in RMQ queue
    And Validate that there is no message in the RMQ queue
    When I "start" zookeeper connectivity for node validation
    Then Validate a request id is returned by resource entity as synchronous response
    And I validate that a "node" is "created" in zookeeper instance
    And Wait for the callback response from "resource entity"
    And I validate that a "node" is "deleted" in zookeeper instance
    When I "stop" zookeeper connectivity for node validation
    And I set BI "ES" url
    And I set api endpoint for "request" record for "read" ES message
    And I set request body for "request" record for "read" ES message
    And I validate that a "request" record is "created" in "bi-orchestrator-requests" index
    And I validate record format for "request" response
    And I validate the "request_type" value in "external-request-tracker"
    And Validate a request id is returned by mediation layer as synchronous response
    And Wait for the callback response from "mediation layer"
    And I validate that a "request" record is "created" in "bi-orchestrator-requests" index
    And I validate that request "state" is "submitted"
    And Validate that no callback response is returned by mediation layer
    And I set BI "RMQ" url
    And I set api endpoint for "publish" message for "sending"

    And Validate that no callback response is returned by mediation layer
    And I set BI "ES" url
    And I set api endpoint for "service" record for "read" ES message
    And I set request body for "service" record for "read" ES message
