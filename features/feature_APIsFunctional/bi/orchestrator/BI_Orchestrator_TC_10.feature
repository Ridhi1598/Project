  This features validates orchestrator response for timed out port activation request

  Scenario: Update ES record for a create service in "bi-orchestrator-services" index
    Given I set data values against testcase
    Given I set BI "ES" url
    Given I create and assign document id for record creation
    And I set api endpoint for "create" a "services" record
    And I set api request body for "create" a "services" record
    When I send HTTP request for "create" service
    Then I validate that the "services" record is "created" in "bi-orchestrator-services" index

    And I validate the "request_type" value in "external-request-tracker"
    And Validate a request id is returned by mediation layer as synchronous response
    And Wait for the callback response from "mediation layer"
    And I validate that a "request" record is "created" in "bi-orchestrator-requests" index
    And I validate record format for "request" response
    And Validate that no callback response is returned by mediation layer
    And I set BI "RMQ" url
    And I set api endpoint for "publish" message for "sending"

    And I validate record format for "service" response
    And Validate that the service record has no record of "associated-requests"

  Scenario: Delete ES record for created service in "bi-orchestrator-services" index
    Given I set data values against testcase
    Given I set BI "ES" url
    And I set api endpoint for "delete" a "services" record
    And I set api request body for "delete" a "services" record
    When I send HTTP request for "delete" service
