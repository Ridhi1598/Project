Feature: Validate ingestion response for modify service
  This features validates ingestion response for modifying a service with unsupported parameter for an existing service

  Scenario: Modify an existing service with unsupported parameter
    Given I read test data for testcase
    Given I set "ingestion" url
    And I generate access token for authorization
    And I Set headers "Content" and "Authorization"
    And I Set "ingestion" api endpoint
    And I Set "ingestion" api request body
    And I Set query parameters for "ingestion" request for "before"
    When I Send HTTP request for "ingestion"
    And I validate the expected response schema
    And I validate that a "service" record is found in "clm-ingestion-service-services" index
    And I validate record format for "service" record
    And I validate the service record for expected "before" "state" value
    And I validate the service record for expected "before" "in-progress" value
