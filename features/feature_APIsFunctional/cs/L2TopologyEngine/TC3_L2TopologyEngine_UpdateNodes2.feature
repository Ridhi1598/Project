Feature: This feature to Update the nodes 2 for L2 Topology

   Background: Clearing the queue as a Test Prerequisite
    Given I set Consumer "RMQ" url
    And I set CS api endpoint "/api/queues/%2F/l2_topology_engine_queue_test/contents" for "DELETE"
    When I send CS "DELETE" request
    And I validate consumer expected response code "204" for "DELETE"
    And I set CS api endpoint "/api/queues/%2F/l2_topology_engine_queue_test/get" for "POST"
    And I Set POST Consumer request Body "rmq_get_message.json" for "l2_topology_engine_queue_test"
    When I send CS "POST" request
    And I validate consumer expected response code "200" for "POST"
    And Validate that the queue is empty for Consumer
    And I set CS api endpoint "/api/queues/%2F/cs_portal_queue_test/contents" for "DELETE"
    When I send CS "DELETE" request
    And I validate consumer expected response code "204" for "DELETE"
    And I set CS api endpoint "/api/queues/%2F/cs_portal_queue_test/get" for "POST"
    And I Set POST Consumer request Body "rmq_get_message.json" for "cs_portal_queue_test"
    When I send CS "POST" request
    And I validate consumer expected response code "200" for "POST"
    And Validate that the queue is empty for Consumer

  Scenario: TC3 Verify the L2 Topology Update node 2
    When I set CS api endpoint "/api/exchanges/%2F/{exchange_Name}/publish" for "POST" to publish the message
    When I Set Consumer POST "TC3_UpdateNodes2.json" request Body to publish the message
    When I send CS "POST" request
    And I validate consumer expected response code "200" for "POST"
    And I set CS api endpoint "/api/queues/%2F/cs_portal_queue_test/get" for "POST"
    And I Set POST Consumer request Body "cs_portal_queue_test_getmessage.json" for "cs_portal_queue_test"
    When I send CS "POST" request
    And I validate consumer expected response code "200" for "POST"
    And I validate the consumer response body contains the request id
    And I validate the consumer response body contains "success"
    And I validate the consumer response body contains "cs-portal/cb-path"
